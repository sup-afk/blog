    <h2>👋 Hello, I'm Supakrit</h2>
  </div>
  <section>
    <p>
      I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> dedicated to crafting efficient, maintainable,
      and user-centric digital experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey in tech is driven by a curiosity for how things work and a
      passion for solving complex problems through code.
    </p>

    <h3>💻 What I Do</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, I focus on modern web technologies and distributed systems. I
      enjoy bridging the gap between robust backend architecture and seamless
      frontend interfaces.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Frontend:</strong> React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
      </li>
      <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, GraphQL</li>
      <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Docker, AWS, Git, CI/CD pipelines</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🚀 My Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      I believe that great software isn't just about writing code; it's about <strong
        >understanding people</strong
      >. Whether I'm refactoring a legacy codebase or architecting a new
      feature, I prioritize:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Readability:</strong> Code is meant to be read by humans first.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scalability:</strong> Building for today while planning for tomorrow.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Ensuring the web remains open and usable for
        everyone.
      </li>
    </ol>
